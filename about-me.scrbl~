#lang scribble/manual


I am passionate about working on impactful projects that serve the community/customers while solving interesting/challenging problems collaboratively with others. I enjoy working in a synergetic and fast-growing environment, in which I can contribute and improve my own skills. I would love to work for a company that cares about the customers and employees. I have worked on many back-end/full-stack oriented projects in the past, and I am interested in developing applications that influence customers positively.



I am also a fun person to work with. Besides coding, I have a life full of joy, friendship, and curiosity. I love to work with others as a team and to communicate with my colleagues. My interest falls into different fields, including traveling, cooking, watching movies, playing Guzheng (a traditional instrument), and listening to music.
